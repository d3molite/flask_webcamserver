# flask_webcamserver
Very minimalistic FLASK Webcamserver which is able to run on a RPI to allow streaming of USB camera video from remote locations.
NOTE: the PI3B+ is too weak to process 720p Video over USB in a stable framerate of at least 30FPS. 
Due to the chip shortage I have not yet been able to source a PI4 for a reasonable price to test this on a more powerful board.
